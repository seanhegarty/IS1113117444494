        <p><strong>Software as a service</strong> - Sales Force.</p><p>Software as a service (SaaS) is a <strong>software distribution model</strong> in which a third-party provider hosts applications and makes them available to customers over the Internet. SaaS removes the need for organizations to install and run applications on their own computers or in their own data centers.  <strong>Rather than purchasing</strong> software to install, or additional hardware to support it, customers subscribe to a SaaS offering. Generally, they pay for this service on a monthly basis using a <strong>pay as you go model</strong>.</p>
